# Delivery-agent-AIML
This project presents an autonomous delivery agent designed to navigate a grid-based city while delivering packages efficiently. The environment consists of blocked cells, varied terrain costs, and moving obstacles with predictable patterns. The agent moves in four directions and makes rational choices to optimize time and fuel.
